# Netlify drawback: https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-can-i-deploy-multiple-repositories-in-a-single-site/179

# To avoid modifying other repos that are routed to from this site, currently ALL their files must be proxied:

# (splat (\*) works only as long as a subsite only have relative paths, e.g.: <img src=something-not-starting-withslash.png>)

# Redirects for /MPFExtractor

/mpfextractor/\* https://mpfextractor.netlify.app/:splat 200!

# Redirects for /room

/room/\* https://student-room.netlify.app/:splat 200!

# Redirects for index and allfix

/\* /index.html 200
/allfix /allfix/index.html 200
/allfix/ /allfix/index.html 200
